# CMSC412FinalProject
This project is the Final Project for CMSC 412.

It acts as a Demand Paging Simulator based off of Module 3 from the reading.  It uses the exact wording from the  
simulations in the reading, and will also print out the different algorithms in an easy to read format.  The user will  
be prompted with several options, and when in a simulation will be prompted to continue or exit.
